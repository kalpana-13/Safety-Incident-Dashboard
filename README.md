# AI Safety Incident Dashboard

This project is a simple web-based **AI Safety Incident Dashboard** designed to track and manage AI-related safety incidents. The dashboard includes functionalities like filtering, sorting, adding new incidents, and viewing detailed descriptions of each incident.

## Features:

- **Filtering**: Filter incidents by severity ("All", "Low", "Medium", "High").
- **Sorting**: Sort incidents by the reported date (Newest First, Oldest First).
- **View Details**: Toggle visibility of the full description of each incident.
- **Report New Incident**: A form to add new incidents, including Title, Description, and Severity.
- **Responsive Layout**: The dashboard uses Flexbox for a responsive design.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the page.
- **TypeScript**: For writing the client-side logic.
- **No Framework**: Pure HTML/CSS/TypeScript (No external frameworks or libraries used).
